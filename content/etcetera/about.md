## Who is David?

My name is pronounced as <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%20david&voice=Brian" target="_blank">_DAH-veed_</a> or <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%20dav%C9%AAd&voice=Brian" target="_blank">_DAH-vid_</a>.

I was born in Venezuela and grew up in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?ll=17.368459,-68.4553&z=5&t=m&hl=en-US&gl=US&mapclient=embed&q=St+Kitts+%26+Nevis" target="_blank_">St. Kitts and Nevis</a>*, W.I. (i.e., _West Indies_).

I completed my primary and secondary school education in St. Kitts: I attended the St. Theresa's Convent High School (referred to as the "Convent School" locally), a private school affiliated with the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church. Since graduating, it has been renamed to the Immaculate Conception Catholic School (or ICCS). I took a wide array of CSEC subjects (equivalent to the British GSCE O-levels). 

After high school, I attended our local community college, the Clarence Fitzroy Bryant College (CFBC), where I obtained my Associate's Degree in General Studies by completing a mix of courses (equivalent to British GCSE A-levels): Pure Mathematics, Computer Science, Communication Studies, Caribbean Studies, and Spanish.

After CFBC, I attended the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI) in St. Thomas (U.S. Virgin Islands), where I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Science and graduated in 2014. From there, I attended the University of South Florida (USF) in Tampa, Florida, USA, to obtain my doctorate in Computer Science & Engineering and graduated in 2020.

## What/Why is David?
I am a roboticist and computer scientist.

I was always an avid learner: I was always fascinated by biology, geography, and technology -- specifically airplanes, handheld electronics, and coding. It has always been a challenge for me to decide on a single area of focus for the remainder of my life. Somehow, I ended up drawn by <i>computing</i> and <i>programming</i>.

What drew me to this field was the excitement I got from learning about logic and program design for problem-solving. At UVI, I learned that computer science is a diverse and broad field. I thoroughly enjoyed algorithms and machine learning at UVI, and I was curious about robotics and artificial intelligence. I credit my advisors <a href="https://www.uvi.edu/directory/faculty/marc-boumedine.html" target="_blank">Dr. Marc Boumedine</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drwaynearchibald" target="_blank">Dr. Wayne Archibald</a> for motivating me to pursue my doctorate.

I dove into the world of robotics and AI at USF, fields of which I had little to no clue about! I joined the Robot Perception and Action Lab (RPAL) under the supervision of <a href="https://cse.usf.edu/~yusun/" target="_blank">Dr. Yu Sun</a>.

## Where is David?

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University and a member of the <a href="http://irl.cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Intelligent Robot Lab</a> directed by <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/" target="_blank">Prof. George Konidaris</a>.

As a postdoc, I aim to develop the skills and experiences needed to lead my own research group one day (while racking up _extra paper_ -- not the monetary kind, of course). 

**I will be on the job market soon!**
