## Random Facts about Me

+ My favicon is the <a href="https://fireemblem.fandom.com/wiki/Crest">Crest of Riegan</a> from the Fire Emblem: Three Houses game!
    + I am a ***major*** fan of the Fire Emblem series (wonderful conversation starter for me).

+ Aside from the FE series, I enjoy other games like Final Fantasy (I've beat 1-6 and 13; 7-8 & 15 are WIP/imminent), Pok√©mon, Phoenix Wright, Sudoku, and Chess (unrated). I am a very casual gamer though.
     + Currently playing ~~the Phoenix Wright games~~ Apollo Justice games!

+ I love British comedy (think [Taskmaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taskmaster_(TV_series)), [Peep Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peep_Show_(British_TV_series)), [The IT Crowd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_IT_Crowd), [WILTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Would_I_Lie_to_You%3F_(game_show)), [Cats Countdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8_Out_of_10_Cats_Does_Countdown), etc.)
