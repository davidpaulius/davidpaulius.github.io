#### Personal Research Goal

My major take-away from a keynote speech by Dr. Wayne Book (Georgia Tech) at IROS 2016 was this: we as researchers should use our talents to help those in need. It was truly inspiring to hear someone successful in our field be so proud of their humanitarian efforts achieved through their work or influence.

I aim to use my researching ability and talents to solve problems for communities or groups in need. I will explore how robotic solutions can solve every-day problems, where robots can efficiently and safely operate and collaborate with humans.
