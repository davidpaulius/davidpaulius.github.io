#### My Role as an Academic

I seek to use my academic gifts and talents to solve every-day problems using *robotics and artificial intelligence (AI)*, particularly for peoples, communities or groups in need. Such robots must efficiently and safely operate around and collaborate with humans.

My journey into an academic role was inspired by my mentors (both in my undergraduate and graduate studies) as well as prominent researchers in robotics.
