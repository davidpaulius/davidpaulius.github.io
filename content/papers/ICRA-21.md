summary: "TL;DR -- In this paper, we attempt to execute task plan sequences extracted from FOONs. However, these sequences may contain actions that are not executable by a robot. Therefore, a human is introduced in the planning and execution loop, and both the robot and human assistant work together to solve the task."

#### NOTES

+ In this paper, we attempt to execute task plan sequences extracted from FOONs. However, these sequences may contain actions that are not executable by a robot. A human is introduced in the planning and execution loop, and both the robot and human assistant work together to solve the task.
+ This was my first attempt at robot execution directly from a FOON. However, I believe a better solution to this problem lies in [task and motion planning bootstrapped by FOONs]({{< ref "RAL-23.md" >}}). [Hierachical planning]({{< ref "CoRL-WS-22.md" >}}) is the way to go!
