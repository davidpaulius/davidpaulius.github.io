summary: "TL;DR -- This paper introduces the motion taxonomy, a collection of robot-relevant features that are better suited for verb or action embedding than conventional word embedding. Motion codes are constructed per verb using the taxonomy. In this work, we show that motion codes assigned to verbs are closely related to one another based on force and trajectory data."

#### NOTES:

+ This paper is the first to introduce the *motion taxonomy*, a collection of robot-relevant features that can be used to describe actions in a binary-encoded format known as *motion codes*.
+ We show that motion codes better capture similarity between actions, which is corroborated by similarities based on force and trajectory data.
