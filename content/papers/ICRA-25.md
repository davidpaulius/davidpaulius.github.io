#### NOTES

+ This paper is to appear at ICRA 2025!
+ This paper builds upon our prior work on [FOON-bootstrapped task and motion planning]({{< ref "RAL-23.md" >}}) by naturally interfacing hierarchical planning with large language models (LLMs).
  + Language models are all the rage nowadays and are excellent at doing few-shot learning and deployment.
  + For this reason, we use them to construct [object-level plans]({{< ref "CoRL-WS-22.md" >}}) (in the form of a FOON), thus overcoming the limitation we have encountered before in hand-crafting FOONs from video.
+ We demonstrate how leveraging automated solving with language models enables better performance on table-top block manipulation tasks.
