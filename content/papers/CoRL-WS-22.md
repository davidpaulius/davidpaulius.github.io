Summary: "TL;DR -- This workshop paper (specifically, a blue-sky submission) introduces the importance of object-level planning and representation as an additional layer on top of task and motion planning. I present several benefits of using object-level planning for long-term use in robotics."

#### NOTES

+ This work was submitted as a "blue-sky" workshop paper, where the goal is to outline some big idea or take some kind of position in terms of a research direction or agenda. 
+ Here, I talk about the benefits of object-level planning, where a robot needs to start with some schematic plan that then is broken down into task- and motion-level planning (as in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01083" target="_blank">TAMP</a>).
