summary: "TL;DR -- This work leverages functional object-oriented networks and deep learning for video understanding. In addition, with the deep network framework, we jointly recognize object and action types, which can then be used for constructing new FOON structures."

#### NOTES

+ This work leverages two deep networks to jointly perform object detection and action recognition, which would be used for matching to object and motion nodes found in functional unit structures in a FOON.
+ Follow-up work by Ahmad explored more [fine-grained object-state recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8803530) for cooking tasks.
    + This work is built upon a [state taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06956) for cooking-related images.
