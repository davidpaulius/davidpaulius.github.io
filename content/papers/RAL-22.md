summary: "TL;DR -- In this paper, we introduce the idea of connecting FOONs to robotic task and motion planning. We automatically transform a FOON graph, which exists at the object level (i.e., it is a representation that uses meaningful labels or expressions close to human language), into task planning specifications written in PDDL (not a very intuitive way to communicate about tasks)."
