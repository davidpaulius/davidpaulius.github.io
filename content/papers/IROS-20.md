#### NOTES

+ In this work, we showed how motion codes (which can be constructed using the motion taxonomy proposed in our RSS 2020 paper) can be used to improve action recognition with deep neural networks.
+ This paper was set to appear in October 2020, but due to the COVID pandemic, the conference was delayed until the following year.
