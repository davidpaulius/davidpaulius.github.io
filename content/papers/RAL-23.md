summary: "TL;DR -- In this paper, we introduce the idea of connecting FOONs to robotic task and motion planning. We automatically transform a FOON graph, which exists at the object level (i.e., it is a representation that uses meaningful labels or expressions close to human language), into task planning specifications written in PDDL (not a very intuitive way to communicate about tasks)."

#### NOTES:

+ David Paulius and [Alejandro Agostini](https://alejandroagostini.github.io/) are joint first authors and corresponding authors.
+ In this work, we introduce the concept of hierarchical planning centered around FOON graphs. Prior to this work, we did not use FOON for robotic execution, so this work was the first of its kind in FOON-related projects.
