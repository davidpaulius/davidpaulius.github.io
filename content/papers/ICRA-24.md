#### NOTES

+ In this paper, we introduce CAPE: an approach to address errors encountered by a robot or agent when executing a plan.
  + We use large language models (LLM) to perform planning and to infer the causes of errors.
  + We assume that these errors lie in preconditions that are not being met by the agent.
  + This work builds upon a [submission made to the NeurIPS 2022 Workshop on Foundation Models for Decision Making](https://openreview.net/forum?id=cMDMRBe1TKs).
+ We showcase our method in simulation (AI2THOR) and with a real robot (Boston Dynamics Spot quadruped robot).
+ This paper is to appear at ICRA 2024!
