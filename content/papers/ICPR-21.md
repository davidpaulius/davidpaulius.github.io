#### NOTES

+ This paper was submitted to the [2020 International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)](https://micc.unifi.it/icpr2020/) but was presented in January 2021 due to the COVID pandemic.
+ This work leverages motion code detection for improving action recognition.
+ We show marked improvement in action recognition performance on videos from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset.
