summary: "TL;DR -- In this paper, we explore methods in natural language processing (NLP) -- specifically semantic similarity -- for expanding or generalizing knowledge contained in a FOON. This alleviates the need for demonstrating and annotating graphs by other means."

#### NOTES:

+ This work explores how we can use [semantic similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_similarity), a concept from natural language processing, for expanding knowledge in a smaller FOON to formulate a larger (or more broadly applicable) knowledge graph.
  + Read more on semantic similarity primarily for sentence similarity [here](https://huggingface.co/tasks/sentence-similarity).
+ We showed in this work that a generalized FOON helps to extend concepts of actions to object categories or never-before-seen objects (from the original source videos).
