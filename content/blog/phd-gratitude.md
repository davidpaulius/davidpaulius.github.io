<i>(I am a very shy person, and I do not feel easy about posting this openly... but if you find this, thank you for reading.)</i>
<br>
<br>
As I reflect on what should have been my graduation date, the only words that come to mind are: <i>Thank You</i>. 
<br>
<br>
It is very difficult for me to accept this as my own victory: I owe a debt of gratitude to my family, my friends, my mentors, and my colleagues and peers at work.
<br>
<br>
This is in no way unattainable by anyone else, as there are many ways that anyone can better themselves. 
I urge anyone to take a leap of faith and dedicate yourself to <i>growth and change</i>. Do whatever makes you happy. 
<br>
<br>
Do not get into the hype of comparing yourself to others (trust me, I am a victim of that). 
<br>
<br>
There is always a way for you to contribute to society. Take the time to find that out for yourself.
<br>
<br>
I have attached my dedication and acknowledgements that I have written in my dissertation here. I hope that I have played a significant part in your lives (in any way, shape or form) or that I can return the favour to you.
<br>
<br>
To anyone who I did not explicitly mention or thank in my work, <i><b>I did not forget you</b></i>!
<br>
<br>
My humblest thanks to you all.
