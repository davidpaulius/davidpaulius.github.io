As I reflect on what should have been my graduation date, the only words that come to mind are: <i>Thank You</i>. 

It is very difficult for me to accept this as my own victory: I owe a debt of gratitude to my family, my friends, my mentors, and my colleagues and peers at work.

This is in no way unattainable by anyone else, as there are many ways that anyone can better themselves. 
I urge anyone to take a leap of faith and dedicate yourself to <i>growth and change</i>. Do whatever makes you happy. 

Do not fall into the trap of constantly comparing yourself to others (trust me, I am a victim of that). 

There is always a way for you to contribute to society. Take the time to find that out for yourself.

Here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kFjwMRgsF_hbBAoiRTMAshy5D8asq7n_/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">link to my dedication and acknowledgements</a> section directly from my dissertation. I hope that I have played a significant part in your lives or that I can return the favour to you.

To anyone who I did not explicitly mention or thank in my work, <i><b>I did not forget you</b></i>!

My humblest thanks to you all.
