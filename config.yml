                    <p style='text-align: justify; border-width: 3px; border-style: solid; padding: 20px;'>David Paulius (he/him) is a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href='http://irl.cs.brown.edu/' target='_blank'>Intelligent Robot Lab</a> at \
                    Brown University, working jointly with Professors <a href='https://cs.brown.edu/~gdk/' target='_blank'>George Konidaris</a> and <a href='https://h2r.cs.brown.edu/' target='_blank'>Stefanie Tellex</a>. \
                    Before joining Brown University, he was a postdoctoral researcher in the \
                    Human-centered Assistive Robotics (HCR) group at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. \
                    David received his PhD in Computer Science & Engineering from the University \
                    of South Florida, where he was advised by Professor Yu Sun and began his journey in \
                    robotics and AI. He received his BSc in Computer Science from the University of the \
                    Virgin Islands, St. Thomas, USVI. He was recognized as a <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2022/' target='_blank'>Robotics: Science and \
                    Systems (RSS) Pioneer</a> in 2022. David is interested in enabling robots to solve complex \
                    goal-directed tasks in dynamic human environments by¬†exploiting commonly available \
                    but unstructured world knowledge. His work explores the integration of classical \
                    planning and foundation models for long-term autonomy and generalization across \
                    robots, task settings, and domains.</p>\
