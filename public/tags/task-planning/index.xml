      <title>Bootstrapping Object-level Planning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/olp-icra25/</link>

      <description>TL;DR &amp;ndash; This paper formalizes the concept of object-level planning and discusses how this level of planning naturally integrates with large language models (LLMs).</description>

      <title>CAPE: Corrective Actions from Precondition Errors using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/cape/</link>

      <description>TL;DR &amp;ndash; In this paper, we introduce CAPE: an approach to correct errors encountered during robot plan execution. We exploit the ability of large language models to generate high-level plans and to reason about causes of errors.</description>

      <title>Approximate Task Tree Retrieval in a Knowledge Network for Robotic Cooking</title>
      <link>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/foon_tree_retrieval/</link>

      <description>TL;DR &amp;ndash; In this paper, we introduce the idea of connecting FOONs to robotic task and motion planning. We automatically transform a FOON graph, which exists at the object level (i.e., it is a representation that uses meaningful labels or expressions close to human language), into task planning specifications written in PDDL (not a very intuitive way to communicate about tasks).</description>

      <title>Robot Learning of Assembly Tasks from Non-expert Demonstrations using Functional Object-Oriented Network</title>
      <link>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/foon_assembly/</link>

      <guid>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/foon_assembly/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR &amp;ndash; This was a collaboration with Clemson University&amp;rsquo;s Yunyi Jia and Yi Chen, who were interested in using FOONs for representing assembly tasks. They successfully utilized and adapted a FOON to robotic assembly execution.</description>

      <title>Task Planning with a Weighted Functional Object-Oriented Network</title>
      <link>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/foon_cobot/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/foon_cobot/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR &amp;ndash; In this paper, we attempt to execute task plan sequences extracted from FOONs. However, these sequences may contain actions that are not executable by a robot. Therefore, a human is introduced in the planning and execution loop, and both the robot and human assistant work together to solve the task.</description>

      <title>Functional Object-Oriented Network: Construction &amp; Expansion</title>
      <link>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/foon_gen_exp/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/foon_gen_exp/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR &amp;ndash; In this paper, we explore methods in natural language processing (NLP) &amp;ndash; specifically semantic similarity &amp;ndash; for expanding or generalizing knowledge contained in a FOON. This alleviates the need for demonstrating and annotating graphs by other means.</description>

      <title>Functional Object-Oriented Network for Manipulation Learning</title>
      <link>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/foon_intro/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://davidpaulius.github.io/papers/foon_intro/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR &amp;ndash; This was the very first paper on FOON: the functional object-oriented network. Here, we introduced what they are and how they can be used for task planning. They are advantageous for their flexibility and human interpretability.</description>
